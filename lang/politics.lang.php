Creating an artificial need for money in order to turn the lower and middle classes into slave wages, those who sit on top of the capitalist food chain contribute barely anything to society and use their unfairly obtained wealth and power to forcefully keep others beneath them. Maintaining this status quo of oppressors and oppressed is the endgame of capitalism, protected by an illusion that anyone could one day become rich themselves and sit on top of the pyramid.

Contraposition is a latin inspired word which means "being against". This manifesto is contrapositionist: it stands against everything that the current sociopolitical system stands for. All that we achieved as a capitalist society is disposable, without any care for the future unless it is for a financial investment, without any consideration for the victims of the system unless it becomes financially relevant to consider them. We worship financial growth as if it were a divinity, building an altar to it from the bones of those who were unlucky enough to stand in the way of the never ending grind of unrestricted greed.

You might be wondering why such a specific and long winded word - contrapositionism - was chosen to name this movement. Simply enough, at the time of writing, it seemed to be the only fitting name that did not return a single result in search engines. A blank slate to build on, which is a rare find in political theory.
EOT

Contrapositionism is built on the shoulders of other political theories. Marxism, socialism, communism, anarchism, anarcho-pacifism, anarcho-syndicalism, feminism, and ecofeminism are all major inspirations. The need for a new paradigm will be discussed later, explaining why contrapositionism reject parts of those ideologies and therefore does not properly fit within any of them.

With this context in mind, we will begin by exploring the violent side of the system. A denouncement of the oppression, domination, submission, and wage slavery that most people experience in their lives. We will then shift into a more positive mindset by thinking about how we can collectively grow, pull others upwards along with us, and become better both as an individual person and as a society.

___('pol_manifesto_contract_1',     'EN', <<<EOT
The system pretends that we are all born as equals, thanks to a so called "social contract": in exchange for performing certain duties, we will be rewarded with certain rights. Respect the law, and you will avoid jail. Vote, and you will be represented in the decision making process. Work, and you will earn money, which you can use to purchase goods. Breed, and your offspring will be given the same duties and rights as you were.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_contract_2',     'EN', <<<EOT
This unwritten "social contract" keeps most people satisfied with the state of society, even pushing many towards a conservative political stance: why would you change a system that works? If you are ill, then you will receive treatment. If you are poor, then you will get assistance. If you are the victim of a crime, then the criminal will be judged and you will be compensated for your suffering. The endless growth in productivity and endless rise in quality of life over time must be proof, in their minds, that this system just works. It must not be questioned, as challenging its status quo could cause a total collapse of the system.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_contract_3',     'EN', <<<EOT
But collapsing the system is the dream of those who have awakened and seen it as it truly is. What is presented to you as a "social contract" is actually a bond of domination between the powerful and the rest of society. Those who are born privileged inherit a better "social contract" than those who are not. The law does not apply to them with the same degree of strictness, justice does not apply to them with the same amount of violence, even when considering working or producing value to society the "social contract" is optional to them - they get all the benefits but do not need to follow any of the duties.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_contract_4',     'EN', <<<EOT
Meanwhile, those who are not given enough privileges from birth are coerced into following their duties to this "social contract" - which they never asked for or agreed to. The mere concept of capitalism goes against the nature of freedom: the exchange of money for work undermines consent, as people would never consent to be yelled at by an old man in a suit every single day, yet here we are. It becomes our duty to the underprivileged to tear up this metaphorical contract in order to free the working class from their chains.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_contract_5',     'EN', <<<EOT
No society can claim freedom or political representation exist when its workers spend most of their day laboring for the interests of privately owned autocracies. We are given leisure to be ourselves, have the lives we desire, yet when asked what your worth is, you will not answer "I am well versed in sociology", "I am a good carpenter", "I help people in need", or even "I am a human being", but instead just give a number: your financial worth. This is what the capitalist system reduces you to. A mere number.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_contract_6',     'EN', <<<EOT
In essence, the "social contract" deprives us of what makes us human. The laws that it follows are written by the dominant class to keep themselves in power. An obvious alternative is possible to this system: let people be who they want to be, do what they want to do, stop rewarding the privileged for being born in the right family, and pull the underprivileged upwards so that they become equal members of society.

___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_1',     'EN', <<<EOT
Capitalism is a political and economic system in which corporations own most of the property and take most of the political decisions. The corporations themselves are the property of one or more rich individuals, who get full decision making power, thus making them the driving forces of the system as a whole.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_2',     'EN', <<<EOT
As a consequence of capitalism, the political system is ruled by wealth, fear, and violence. Fascists prey on the uneducated masses who are tired of capitalism by convincing them that minorities are the real problem within our society. Meanwhile capitalists game the electoral system by saying "don't vote for this fascist" even though their own system contributes to people's willingness to listen to said fascist. They purposely and knowingly invest in raw hate in order to maintain their position on top.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_3',     'EN', <<<EOT
Not only do the rich prey on the lower classes to keep themselves in power, they also turn them into slave wages by making every necessary commodity (water, food, health care, etc.) worth arbitrary amounts of money. This forces people to work if they want to survive, even if it means working awful jobs that should not exist or should be replaced by machines, even if it means stifling their creativity and preventing them from contributing to society in more useful ways. All in all, the ultra rich are well adapted parasites. Their existence is mostly detrimental to their host organism, without which they would not be able to survive.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_4',     'EN', <<<EOT
The ultra rich's accumulation of wealth knows no limit, growing boundlessly only to be transferred to the next generation through the patrilineal inheritance system that we have maintained since the middle ages. They would be angry if they discovered a resource leak within their corporations, yet they are a massive resource leak in their own system. Their endless race for growth forces society as a whole to exhaust the planet's resources, which are necessary for citizens of poorer countries to simply survive and have a future at all.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_5',     'EN', <<<EOT
There is no justification for the ultra wealthy to exist in a world where poverty also exists. However, they use their positions of power to spread class contempt, making us afraid of the underprivileged instead of willing to help them. Through closed borders, they ensure that those who are born in poorer areas of the world have no chance at the opportunities that the richer countries can offer. By spreading hate and maintaining systemic racism through the political game, they also keep themselves as a social class on top, ensuring that aspects of our being that we can not change - ancestry, skin color, gender, sexual orientation, physical handicaps - will constantly contribute to pushing the underprivileged below the rest of society.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_6',     'EN', <<<EOT
Yet, the rich need the underprivileged. Closed borders are a tool used to create masses of economic migrants that will work cheaply and get exploited by capitalists out of fear of being sent back to their home country. Minimum wage workers will have no money to save, investing all of their earnings back into the goods produced by the corporations owned by the wealthy. Oppressed minorities become opportunities to market specialized products, causing the wealthy to pinkwash or greenwash their corporations in exchange for a bigger range of devoted customers.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_7',     'EN', <<<EOT
When pondering the good and bad sides of capitalism, it is common to consider that the opposite of a privately owned corporation is a state owned corporation. Fear of an overly powerful state and the pipe dream of one day becoming the owner of a powerful corporation makes people forgiving towards the system's failures. However, it is critical to keep in mind that there are more alternatives to capitalism than you might think: for example, corporations could be owned by unions, workers, or people, and contribute to the collective good. The state could become the sole owner of capitalist markets for primary necessities (water, food, health care, etc.), and citizens could become owners of the state through less pyramidal politics.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_capitalism_8',     'EN', <<<EOT
As an aside, capitalists love to point at the death tolls of other political or economic systems. This makes it important for us to face the death toll of capitalism: slavery, colonialism, endless useless wars, fascist puppet regimes used for proxy wars, work accidents, suicides caused by burnout, artificially caused famines, collateral victims of police brutality and military violence, the current and upcoming climate change deaths. All these things have been done in the name of capital gain or maintaining the status quo of the current system.

___('pol_manifesto_violence_1',     'EN', <<<EOT
The system's status quo rests on violence. The upper classes keep themselves on top through their control of the judicial system. They make sure that the laws they pass are enforced through their control of the police and military, whose jobs include making use of physical violence.
EOT

How can anyone respect the rule of law when the laws are written by the dominant class to keep themselves in power? The disproportionate crime statistics of minorities are not caused by inherent violent tendencies in these minorities, but rather by the fact that the legal system targets them disproportionately. Every time the underprivileged find a new way to survive without relying on the privileged, a new law will follow to make it illegal, and police repression will be mandated to enforce this new law.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_violence_3',     'EN', <<<EOT
To make sure the masses remain docile, nationalism is used as a pretext. Basic necessities must be purchased using money earned through wage slavery, for the sake of the country's growth, lest it be overtaken by the growth of other rival countries. Migrants must be sent back to their home country, for the sake of preserving the country's "national identity" - in other words: eugenics. Preventive wars must be fought in poor countries to protect rich countries from imaginary threats, for the glory of the country's might and radiance.
EOT

These countries are all arbitrary plots of lands whose borders have been decided by the elders of our elder's elders, sometimes even stolen from the natives who lived there first. They hold worth only in the eyes of those who have been thoroughly indoctrinated by the system's schools, which include a lot of violent rhetoric and nationalist fearmongering within their study programs. A shame, given how education for all is by far the most important tool in reducing inequalities and giving everyone equal opportunities in life. Instead of its true purpose, education is being bent as a propaganda tool in ways optimized by the fascists and nazis of old, repurposed for modern society by the political ruling class.

For the country's sake, anything will be tolerated. Political leaders openly order war crimes, which their military force will gladly comply with. Some even build and maintain nuclear arsenals, being able to press a self destruct button on the whole planet for the sake of their country's grandeur. Drunk on the perceived superiority of their culture and country, citizens will encourage their government in this globally scaled mutual destruction, applauding acts of war, sending their own children to die for the sake of the wealthy's exploitation of the markets created by these constant wars.
EOT

On a local scale, the ruling political class will use the threat of terrorism to terrorize their own citizens into giving up their basic rights to freedom. Establishment politicians will celebrate with glee as the people they have sworn to protect get blown to pieces by the villains that they themselves created through their wars and international manipulations. When the citizens try to fight back against this status quo, they too get labeled terrorists. Fascists get to openly demonstrate in the streets, but any glimpse of antifascism will get violently fought by the police or the military as if they were committing acts of terror by resisting fascism.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_violence_7',     'EN', <<<EOT
In order to maintain their grasp on the people, the ruling political class and the wealthy will use the service of police forces. Theoretically meant to protect all citizens, they will only ensure the law is applied to the underprivileged, through the usage of violence. Those in the police forces who disagree with their role as oppressors get silenced or booted away, turning state police into a gang of violent thugs. As police members are rarely if at all punished for their exactions when they make excessive use of violence, this gives them the belief that they are above the law, which creates a feedback loop of infinitely escalating one sided violence. It is for good reason that the underprivileged tend to say - once they become victims of this unfair police system - that all cops are bastards. The job itself has become one that only a bastard could hold.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_violence_8',     'EN', <<<EOT
Meanwhile, those who break the law get piled up in jails without regard for their lives. Even the smallest offense, even if done for the sake of survival, will lead the underprivileged to jail. In there, locked up along with actually violent criminals, they build up resentment against the system, ensuring that minor offenders can turn into violent criminals once released, thus padding up the crime statistics used by the ruling class to fan the flames of racism and hate. Instead of trying to prevent, the system punishes. Instead of trying to educate, the system locks people up. Capitalism must have prisons to protect itself from the criminals that it creates.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_violence_9',     'EN', <<<EOT
The dominant class tries to make anyone who opposes the law, the police, the military, or other forms of state controlled violence look like a deviant, regardless of the context. In a climate of perpetual violence - which mostly targets minorities - being politically neutral is akin to being an accomplice to this systemic brutality. Neutrals, often too privileged to grasp the suffering of the underprivileged, are choosing the side of the oppressor. It is our duty to awaken them to the reality of the system's violence.

Using the threat of state violence, capitalism pushes its underprivileged citizens to follow the one and only allowed way of life: work or live an even more miserable life.

Projecting their suffering on others, victims of the system will disregard those who they perceive as parasites - ignoring the fact that the true parasites of society are the privileged. What does a land owner or landlord contribute to the common good, other than collecting the money of the working class without much care for the condition of the land or housing they provide? What does a shareholder contribute to society other than collecting dividends and imposing their views on how companies should be ran in order to maximize profit, without care for the workers that will suffer under wage slavery to bring them said profit.

The success of a country is measured in work related metrics: How low is unemployment? How high is the GDP? How strong is growth?

Work has become such a core part of the system that people would go to their jobs ill and risk spreading diseases rather than staying home. Employees are so afraid of the violent and unforgiving nature of work that it makes sense for them to threaten the collective wellbeing out of fear of personal punishment.

Even in an ideal society where shareholders do not need to exist, where land owners and landlords are replaced by cooperatives of those who actually live in the land or the buildings, the value of work itself deserves to be questioned. Why do we work? What are we trying to achieve? Any work done as a learning experience, for personal growth, or for personal enjoyment is a net positive. Any work done for the collective good, with the end goal of improving the lives of each other, should most definitely be encouraged. Any other form of work has no reason to exist.

In this ideal society where work is chosen and not done under threat, people would be able to live the lives they desire and set their own goals in how they want to contribute to society.

For in this society of tomorrow, the so called "bullshit jobs" will be gone for good. Faced with problems that are currently being solved with wage slave labor, we will have to invent new solutions. Who will transport food or materials between producers and consumers? A collective solution will be to encourage those who travel to also transport goods. Who will clean up trash from the streets? It will be the perfect opportunity to learn as a community about recycling, trying to reach the zero waste goals needed for our collective survival on this planet that the capitalist consumerist society does not seem to care about.

As for the manufacturing jobs that produce the goods we consume, those would disappear thanks to automation. Few people will truly miss being a factory slave, working tedious jobs on assembly lines in exchange for the bare minimum required to survive. Former factory workers will still be able to transform their talents in manufacturing into true craftmanship, bringing back a higher quality of goods that have disappeared for lack of profitability or become exclusive to the privileged due to their price.

Another side effect of turning work into a choice will be the creation of local communities of like minded workers, learning from each other, combining their skills. Education also would become more efficient, giving passionate teachers more leeway to transfer their knowledge and passion to the next generation. Without the hysterical paranoia of losing their jobs to migrants, and with education drained of its nationalist component, closed borders would no longer be necessary and the rest of the world would be forced to become a better place for their citizens or risk losing them to this new society as they would inevitably escape the capitalistic dictatorship of work to join it.

Perhaps this all sounds too utopian, but to someone who would not know of capitalism, how nightmarish would capitalism sound? The current system is beyond extreme in the violence of wage slavery, thus any other normal system sounds so far removed from it that it will be perceived as being the extreme one.

The usual defense of capitalism includes the dubious statement that without capitalism, we would never have done the leaps and bounds in science and technology that led us to the industrial and digital revolutions. Proud of human advancement powered by child labor and wage slavery, capitalists will dare claim that the world becomes a better place thanks to the benevolence of the ultra rich, who are "forced" to always innovate and improve the products they sell if they are to stay alive on the financial markets.

A closer look at capitalistic history will show that this is pure fantasy.

When its inventor purposefully decided not to patent the polio vaccine, global health improved greatly, sparing many children from an uncurable life long illness.

Human nature is one of mutual aid. Just like in many other animal species, until capitalism and its patents appeared, progress had always been done through sharing knowledge and building upon the work of others to expand collective potential. The very people who mourn the destruction of the former Great Library of Alexandria will not realize that they are forbidden from reusing anything learned from a modern book or patent.

Further holding down potential artists, the system mocks those who choose to express themselves by pursuing a career in liberal arts, considering them failures for their inability to pick a field of study that leads to a stable and profitable job.

Writers, producers, and actors would still be respected, but for their artistic ability rather than for their ability to earn money back on investments.

Believing that centrists, conservatives, and fascists will disappear along with capitalism's inevitable collapse, contrapositionism considers itself a future "third way", placed somewhere in the middle of the marxist political spectrum. This is why what capitalists call "far left" politics have so much infighting: the modern political scale is heavily skewed by capitalism, as social-democrats, centrists, and conservatives would ally even with fascists in their greedy pursuit of money and power.

However, once the fight is over and the entire center and right sides of the capitalist political board disappear forever, we will have to choose new sides. Contrapositionism, even though it is inspired by other similar political theories and agrees with most of their substance, has irreconcilable differences with some of them that sets it apart.

Marxism, the idea that society is a product of class struggle between the ruling class and the proletariat, is an obvious major source of inspiration. Marx's analysis of the social contract as stripping workers of their consent and humans of their nature is mirrored throughout this manifesto. His analysis went as far as taking into account post-scarcity economy, discussing the value of labor in a world of automation - a visionary perspective for its time. As it is not in itself a political movement, we have no reason to reject it, for we are the direct grandchildren of Marx's ideas.

Socialism, the idea that capitalism must be replaced by shared ownership of the means of production, is in agreement with this manifesto's baseline. However, socialism has been ruined by time, becoming what is nowadays referred to as "champagne socialism", a bourgeois ideology fueled by white guilt in which the privileged share part of their wealth with the underprivileged to shut them up temporarily. Undeniably, socialism has brought us many social advances, but all of them within the boundaries of capitalism. It is time to move on and let this once beautiful ideology rot in the rear view mirror of political theory.

Communism, the idea that social classes and the state must be fully abolished, is a beautiful but utopian pipe dream. Criticism of communism often points accusative fingers at the totalitarian regimes that borrowed its name, but in Marx's own theory, communism is an evolution of socialism. Trying to skip a step by going straight from capitalism into communism is a quixotic ideal. Contrapositionism also places itself as a transitional society, a realistic step up from capitalism, an alternative to socialism which could later itself be used as a stepping stone into communism. Simply put, it is too early for communism to make sense.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_inspirations_6',     'EN', <<<EOT
Anarchism, the idea that hierarchy causes violence and that the concept of a state itself must be rejected, is also an important source of inspiration. In particular, the writings of Kropotkin on mutual aid are directly mentioned in multiple parts of the manifesto. Even though people think of anarchism as a violent or disorganized ideology, it is quite the opposite. Anarchism is an inherently peaceful ideology, calling for the removal of the main sources of violence in society: the state and the privileged. However, the power vacuum of a stateless society would likely lead to a power grab by opportunistic totalitarians. It is a sad byproduct of human nature that a state must exist, though stripped of as much violent power as possible.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_inspirations_7',     'EN', <<<EOT
Anarcho-pacifism takes anarchism a step further by refusing to use violence in the conflict against capitalism. Fueled by the famous success of Mahatma Gandhi against India's colonial oppressors, anarcho-pacifists have grown in confidence that the removal of power structures can be achieved peacefully. As much as contrapositionism would like to be in agreement with this beautiful ideology, the mere fact that states, capitalists, and fascists use violence to maintain their domination of the underprivileged requires at least the ability to strike back against them. Violence is required against those who preach violent ideologies, punching a fascist is not an option but a duty. However, violence must only be a last resort, a defensive option used in situations when no other move exists, and it must always spare the innocent from any collateral damage.

Anarcho-syndicalism twists anarchism in another direction, suggesting that workers hold the power and should use it to topple the very power structures that turned them into wage slaves. Emphasizing direct action, it is a movement based on dissension, showing states and corporations that they are not needed to keep society running. A necessary step in the transition out of capitalism, anarcho-syndicalists are strong allies, but their ideology puts too much emphasis on workers. Removing the state's power should not lead to unions being the new ruling class, even if they have the best interests of the workers in mind - especially in a post-scarcity society where automation replaces manual jobs and full time work loses its importance.

An extremely touchy ideology to partially reject, feminism is a movement that began as a fight for women's rights, and has since evolved into a struggle for the support of all minorities against institutional oppression. As much as this manifesto uses many feminist talking points and supports the feminist movement, it must be pointed out that the fight for equal rights is not always a fight for progress. Fighting for 50% female slave ownership is a vain fight when the common fight should be against slavery itself. As for the intersectionality aspect, it becomes dangerous when it gives uncontested voices to every minority, as some of them are oppressors to other minorities. A risky game of power struggle between minorities is always brewing underneath the surface of intersectional feminism, often ending with voices being silenced by those who should have been defending them. With this in mind, contrapositionism is a feminist movement, but wishes that feminism would be more proactive in ridding itself of its regressive components.

A lesser known ideology, ecofeminism suggests that nature has become an underprivileged entity along with other minorities, and thus the fight for feminism is one with the fight for ecology. Taking intersectionality to its extreme by pooling every fight together puts an interesting perspective on the unhealthy relationships between nature and privilege, spirituality and patriarchy, scientific progress and social injustice. However, the ideology has been pushed too far, often rejecting those who do not accept the link between the female body and nature. This emphasis on physicality implies a rejection of trans women. Thus, contrapositionism borrows a lot from the theoretical side of ecofeminism, but can not adhere to the spiritual side of ecofeminism.

The rejection of aspects of all these ideologies is why contrapositionism exists in the first place - trying to show that a "third way" is possible for those who struggle to find an ideology that they fully agree with.

For some, peace of mind can not come without spirituality. With all due respect, it is important to remind them that organized religions are some of the strongest actors of the current system of oppression, hanging on to patriarchal conservative views and using their protected status to openly preach regressive views. This means that even within spirituality, there is a fight to be had: a fight for progress, representation, equality. This fight is easily dismissed by conservatives citing the unalterable nature of ancient writings, but truly religion is a spiritual framework that should be interpreted on a personal level. Preachers are but mortal beings, trying to hold together the system they were born into. This system too must be toppled, replaced by a better one that will allow spirituality to be what it should be: a force for good, for helping those who are lost.

<span class="text_red bold glow">19 · Abolish exclusive intellectual property.</span> Copyrights and patents are holding back science, art, and health care. Any form of intellectual property that prevents others from building upon existing things must disappear along with capitalism.

<span class="text_red bold glow">24 · Unite with like-minded movements.</span> We must come to the realization that we all have a common enemy in capitalism, and should unite along with similar political movements to fight centrists, neutrals, conservatives, capitalists, and fascists.

<span class="text_red bold glow">25 · Enact electoral reform.</span> Rotten electoral systems will destroy people's trust in politics. Switch to ranked choice single transferable votes or similar systems that make people choose their representatives instead of voting for those they hate the least. This will encourage diversity in the political discourse, create more varied political bodies, and encourage compromise and alliances rather than majority rule.

<span class="text_red bold glow">26 · Clean up political corruption.</span> Encourage the fact checking of anything politicians say. Exclude politicians from the system if they get caught defending interests other than those of the people they serve. Career politicians are a good thing, they accumulate experience and knowledge, but they must serve the people, not third party interests.

<span class="text_red bold glow">27 · Disband centralized governments.</span> Head of states have too much power, they represent a modern version of divine right monarchs. The existence of such power drives power hungry fiends into becoming career politicians. Instead, governments should be small scaled, local, and have no ruler as their head. Large scale decisions can be taken by exceptional assemblies of representatives of local political bodies.

<span class="text_red bold glow">28 · Govern for the future.</span> As politics require planning ahead, they must serve those who have a long future ahead of them. There should be a maximum age of 60 years old on both voting and being an elected official. Politicians aged 60 or older should still remain involved in the system in a consulting role if they so desire, as younger ones will have a lot to learn from their accumulated experience.

<span class="text_red bold glow">33 · Ruthlessly depollute.</span> The environmental emergency has reached a point of non return.

<span class="text_red bold glow">34 · Rethink transportation.</span> Encourage local public transports, shared rides, and non motorized transportation methods. In urban areas, increase the space offered to pedestrians. Mutualize the transportation of goods, so that there is no more need for private transportation dedicated to moving specific goods around.

<span class="text_red bold glow">35 · Free farm animals.</span> The mass exploitation of farm animals for the sole purpose of slaughtering them must end. Not only is it inhumane, but it also heavily contributes to climate change. We should have symbiotic relationships with animals, not be their tormentors.

<span class="text_red bold glow">36 · Forget about monoculture.</span> Agriculture too should respect diversity. Replace infinitely spanning fields with polycultures and forests. Humanity will easily be able to survive the drop in food production as farm animals - not humans - are the main consumers of the crops grown in monocultures.

<span class="text_red bold glow">37 · Think locally.</span> Reduce the need to transport goods whenever possible. Encourage everyone to learn about agriculture so that they can grow crops locally as communities. Undo excessive concreteization in urban areas in order to give nature some space back in our lives.

<span class="text_red bold glow">40 · Never give up.</span> If you can not find the strength to fight, then do not blame yourself and let others fight for you until you can gather the required strength. Remember that even once the battle is won, the fight is not over: contrapositionism is a transitional ideology, a set of goals that should be accomplished to advance society in a better direction. Once those goals are accomplished, it will be time to move on and create new political theories. Encourage political thinking, and make political theory as accessible as possible to all.

___('pol_manifesto_praxis_quote',     'EN', "The system must fall apart before the planet does");
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_intro_1',   'EN', <<<EOT
Praxis is the act of taking any theory and turning it into reality. In the case of political theory, praxis encompasses any form of activism, including simply educating others or spreading a message.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_intro_2',   'EN', <<<EOT
If you are in agreement with this political manifesto, then the next logical step is praxis. Destroying a system is a long term endeavor, born of a collective drive for change. Everyone can do their part, even those who are too scared to act publicly, even the ones who think they do not have the strength or the ability to act at all.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_intro_3',   'EN', <<<EOT
Below are ten of the simplest ways to achieve praxis. Just like the solutions presented above, these are mere guidelines to battling the system from within, not mandatory rules to follow. It is up to you to pool up your collective creativity and come up with other ways to achieve praxis, which is a necessary step given the urgency of the situation - the system must fall apart before the planet does.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_1',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">1 · Spread the word.</span> There are many others out there who could harbor revolutionary ideas, but need to be guided in the right direction. Exposing them to the failures of the system, and showing them solutions for a better future is key to releasing them from the trap of neutrality. They must be brought to the realization that political centrism is complicit to the violence of the system, as not rejecting the abuses of the system is seen as tacit approval by the ruling class.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_2',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">2 · Grow social circles.</span> Growing as a movement requires unity, and organization. This comes through the establishment of politically like-minded social circles. Break away from the conservatives, capitalists, and fascists around you. Join or create new social circles, actively drain them of any toxicity, and build them up as outlets that bring you comfort to help in relieving your mind from the constant systemic violence.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_3',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">3 · Hold workshops.</span> In these social circles, it is important to take the required time to listen to everyone. Always challenging your own views is necessary. The best way to achieve it is to hold workshops where people talk about their experiences as underprivileged members of the system, and others simply listen and learn. Invite people external to your circles, listen to what they have to say, and use the experiences of others to grow yourself as a person.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_4',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">4 · Go vote.</span> It might seem like a lost cause given the unfairness of the electoral system, but every single voice counts when telling capitalism to get bent. Support your local anticapitalist candidates, vote against fascism, make capitalists afraid, and remember that change will come from within.
EOT

___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_5',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">5 · Unionize.</span> Capitalists are deathly afraid of any loss of productivity. Unions threaten their livelihood. Strikes weaken them. It might not always be safe to do so, but if you are a member of the capitalist workforce, then unionizing is your most efficient method of direct action.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_6',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">6 · Show yourself.</span> Capitalism turned politics into a show of public image. To grow a movement, it must grow not only in size and reach but also in visibility. Everything from flyers to posters to banners in demonstrations is helpful, especially if they catch the eye and send a clear message. Become a part of public culture. Become art, become memes, make yourselves a known element of the public discourse.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_7',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">7 · Share knowledge.</span> Make use of modern technology to share as much knowledge and as many tools as possible with each other. Ensure that anything you create is protected by permissive intellectual property licenses, so that it can not be appropriated by capitalists, but can also be shared and used freely without any limits. Become the bearers and sharers of collective knowledge.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_8',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">8 · Document systemic violence.</span> Helping others understand just how violent the system is requires facts, sources, comprehensive documentation. It is the duty of those who oppose the system to not let those events of systemic violence idly go by one by one, but rather to centralize lists showing just how widespread it is.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_9',  'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">9 · Use your privilege.</span> For those who are lucky enough to have some privileges, it is important that you make use of them - not because you can, but because you must. In capitalism, the underprivileged can only rely on the privileged to relieve them from the oppression of the system. However, do not do it seeking glory. Getting credit for actions that you are able to do solely because the system allows you to do them should be cause for selflessness, not for personal validation.
EOT
);
___('pol_manifesto_praxis_points_10', 'EN', <<<EOT
<span class="text_red bold glow">10 · Fight fascism.</span> Capitalism harbors fascism and breeds it, using it as a tool to scare the masses. Sometimes, their creation gets out of their control, and needs to be kept in check. Even though pacifism is an important virtue when trying to rally the masses to your cause, the oppression of fascism justifies violence.
